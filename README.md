# Installation

First you need to go the certain files and change them :

- .env
- app/Constants/Constants.php

then you need to deploy the project and test that it works perfectly with the help of either 
postman or insomnia 

# how to use

i provided a json file that you can import into insomnia that will show you how to interact with the api i created
it's simple you just need to make requests to those routes and everything will work fine you don't need to think about bandwidth anymore
it will simply work 

the web integration is your web guy job, if he needed help of any kind tell him to contact me directly i will help explain it to him.
